> Pointer is a new optional.

There are a lot of implementations of optional types in Golang like https://github.com/moznion/go-optional
or https://github.com/markphelps/optional.

But actually there is no lack in optional but in references. The `go-ptr-tools` package introduce a new type `ref.Ref`.
Also, there is a set of widely used functions to work with pointers.

Additionally, a bunch of recipes to work with optional values using pointers are provided.
And some anti-patterns are explained.
